Ground rules:
1. COMMENT ALL YOUR CHANGES IN BOTH CODE AND PLAN.TXT
2. don't be an asshole >:3

Plan:
-Have a function that parses the input file
    -have the data be converted into an object
    -basically a map of each node with their connections (adjacent)
        -a node should be its own object with:
            -a name
            -a list of its adjacent nodes
            -a color
-Fill out a map
    -each region in the given map has a color node
    -go through each node and select a color to paint it based on the CSP
-Have a way to fetch the next node
    -first with minimum remaining values, aka the nodes with the least number of values available
    -second with the degree heuristic, aka least number of adjacent nodes (i think, double check)
    -afterwards, if there are any ties, just pick one randomly
-Foward checking: just recursively check if there's a dead end??????
-Use next() and forward checking to output final map
