Ground rules:
1. COMMENT ALL YOUR CHANGES IN BOTH CODE AND PLAN.TXT
2. don't be an asshole

Plan:
-Have a function that parses the input file
    -have the data be converted into an object
    -basically a map of each node with their connections (adjacent)
-Have a way to fetch the next node
    -first with minimum remaining values, aka the nodes with the least number of values available
    -second with the degree heuristic, aka least number of adjacent nodes (i think, double check)
    -afterwards, if there are any ties, just pick one randomly
-Foward checking: just recursively check if there's a dead end??????
